**Here we go!**

This time around, we're all about style. 

The index.html contains just some super simple elements to give us something to play with.

Check out the requirements below and alter the index.html content and the style.css content
to acheive each of these requirements. Don't forget to look back at the curriculum (the CTRL+F
will be your friend here) to remind yourself how each of these elements work. Don't forget
you can always check out Mozilla Developer Network to dive deeper if you need or want to!


Challenge:
1. Change the background color of the `body` element to "#e9e9e9".
2. Increase the font size of the `h1` element to 32 pixels.
3. Add a 2-pixel solid border to the `container` class with the color "#ccc".
4. Change the text color of the `button` element to "#fff".
5. Add a 4-pixel border radius to the `button` element.
6. Add a 10-pixel padding to the top and bottom of the `button` element.
7. Add a hover effect to the `button` element that changes the background color to "#0056b3" when the mouse hovers over it.

Your task is to apply these changes to the provided HTML and CSS files to alter the appearance of the elements in the browser.
